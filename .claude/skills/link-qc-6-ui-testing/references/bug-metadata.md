# Bug metadata field values

Closed-list values for the `Bug Trigger`, `Impact` and `Classification`
fields, loaded from Step 4B of SKILL.md. Choose exactly one value from each.

**These lists are the suite's default catalogue** (the Azure DevOps process
template most consumer projects use). Before the first report in a project,
check `Testing/project-learning.md` → `### UI Visual QA Model (skill 6)` for the
tracker's actual field values; when the project records different ones, use
those and keep this file as the fallback. `Testing Type: Integration Testing`
is likewise the default value — override it only when the project's tracker or
learning file says so. Severity and Priority values follow constitution QC-14 /
QC-10 (the `qa_standards` file); this file only maps metadata onto them.

**Bug Trigger**

- `Basic Coverage`: failure in an ordinary primary flow.
- `Coverage with Varied Input`: failure occurs with a particular valid or invalid input variation.
- `Design Conformance`: mismatch with an approved design or visual specification.
- `Module Interaction`: failure occurs when two or more modules/features interact.
- `Rare Situation`: unusual boundary, interruption, recovery, or low-frequency condition.
- `Security Testing`: security or authorization testing revealed the issue.
- `Software Configuration`: environment, device, OS, permission, feature flag, or configuration dependent.
- `Special Sequence`: only a particular action order or state transition triggers it.
- `Workload/Stress`: load, volume, concurrency, or resource pressure triggers it.

For a bug from a **design-comparison** section (Steps 2A/3), most bugs will be
`Design Conformance`. For a bug from a **no-design heuristic** section (Step
2B), `Design Conformance` is never valid — there is no design to conform to.
Use whichever value actually fits the observed cause instead: an RTL mirroring
break is usually `Software Configuration` (locale-dependent) or `Special
Sequence` if it only shows up after a particular interaction; a plain internal
color/spacing inconsistency is usually `Basic Coverage`.

**Impact**

- `Functionality`: feature behavior or business flow is wrong.
- `Integrity/Security`: authorization, privacy, correctness, or stored-data integrity is at risk.
- `Performance`: responsiveness, throughput, stability under load, or resource use is affected.
- `Usability`: users can complete the task, but the experience is confusing or difficult.
- `User Interface`: visual styling, spacing, alignment, clipping, or presentation is wrong.

Most visual QA bugs are `User Interface`. Use `Usability` when the issue
genuinely makes the task harder to complete rather than just cosmetically
off — this is common for heuristic-mode bugs like poor contrast, missing
focus states, or broken RTL flow.

**Classification**

- `Design nonconformance`
- `Fields issue`
- `General Usability`
- `Labels , Texting and Validation msgs` (in the default process template the Azure field combines the "Labels" and "Texting and Validation messages" categories into one option — do not send them as two separate values, the API rejects both `Labels` and `Texting and Validation messages` alone)
- `Logic defects (out of RSD)`
- `Navigation issues`
- `Not implemented Functionality`
- `Not working Functionality`
- `Performance`
- `RSD nonconformance`
- `Security`
- `Server/JS error`
- `Spelling mistakes`
- `Translation`
- `UI/Layout Issue`
- `Unsaved/non-reflected data`

Use `RSD nonconformance` only when an accessible requirement explicitly proves
the mismatch. Use `Design nonconformance` only when an accessible approved
design proves it — for a design-comparison section, the Figma reference (Step
2A) or provided design screenshot is that proof, so most of those bugs should
use `Design nonconformance`. For a **no-design heuristic** section, there is
by definition no such proof, so never use `Design nonconformance` there —
pick the most specific observable classification instead: `UI/Layout Issue`
for spacing/alignment/contrast problems, `General Usability` for broken
affordances or hierarchy issues, `Navigation issues` for broken RTL nav/flow,
`Translation` for AR string/locale problems.

**Automated accessibility findings** (axe-core, Pass 1b).

> Policy: constitution "Quality Control" article QC-10 (axe impact → Severity / Priority mapping, one bug per rule, `incomplete` never counted). This skill applies it and does not restate it.

Metadata values per axe `impact`:

| axe `impact` | Bug Trigger | Impact | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| critical | Basic Coverage | Usability | General Usability |
| serious | Basic Coverage | Usability | General Usability |
| moderate | Basic Coverage | Usability | UI/Layout Issue |
| minor | Basic Coverage | User Interface | UI/Layout Issue |

Exceptions: a missing form label or an unlabelled control is `Fields issue`; a
wrong `lang` / `dir` on an AR page is `Translation`; keyboard traps and missing
landmarks / skip links are `Navigation issues`. In a design-comparison section
an accessibility rule is still never `Design Conformance` — the design did not
specify ARIA.

This list is a starting reference, not guaranteed to be exhaustive — a
project's tracker fields can differ subtly (spacing, abbreviations, combined
options); the project's learning file wins when it records different values.
Azure DevOps publishing and synchronisation are out of scope (constitution
QC-17); the report stays local.
